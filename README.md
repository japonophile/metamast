# Metamast

[Metamath](http://us.metamath.org/) parser written in Rust.

I had fun [building one in Clojure](https://github.com/japonophile/mm-clj) but it could not parse set.mm, due to memory overflow (and was very slow).
Looking at other options, and it's a good opportunity to get my hands dirty and learn Rust.
